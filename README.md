# KiCad Symbols, Footprints and Templates

This repository contains my personal KiCad templates, schematic symbolic and footprint libraries. The libraries adn templates in this repository are intended for KiCad version 5 or a nightly build that supports the schematic library version 2.4 or newer. Each symbol is stored as a `.lib` and `.dcm` file pair. Each footprint is stored as a directory with the `.pretty` suffix.
